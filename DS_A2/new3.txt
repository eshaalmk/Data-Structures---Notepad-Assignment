In a quiet town the sun rose softly over the hills
  casting a gentle light on the quiet streets Birds
  chirped filling the air with a melody a melody that
  brought peace The townsfolk awoke to another
  quiet day feeling the warmth of the sun grateful for the calm morning
another quiet day feeling the quiet warmth of the sun grateful for the quiet calm morning a
melody a feeling melody that brought peace
